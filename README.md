Scripts and Programs from Christopher Pineda and Gabriel Siegel's ECE 258 Project

1. ReadArduinoVoltage.M - an incomplete program to graph and save data from an arduino analog pin.

2. SPIAttempt8.ino - the most recent SPI we had before our project went virtual. It communicates from the Arduino to a DAC to create a trapezoidal wave.

3. readcsv.m - A script to read and graph data from a .csv file, like those obtained from an oscilloscope reading. It graphs voltage and current response against time.

4. tek0059ALL.csv - A sample .csv file.
